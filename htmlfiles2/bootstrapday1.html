    <p>HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the foundational language used to create the structure of web pages. It organizes content using elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, and images. Every website on the internet is built using HTML at its core. With the introduction of HTML5, developers can now include multimedia content and semantic elements more efficiently. It provides the skeleton upon which all other web technologies are built.</p>

    <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style and layout HTML content on a web page. It allows developers to change fonts, colors, spacing, and positions of elements to make the design more appealing. CSS can be applied inline, within the HTML file, or through external stylesheets. Modern CSS also includes powerful features like animations, Flexbox, and Grid for complex layouts. It plays a crucial role in making websites look attractive and responsive.</p>

    <p>JavaScript is a programming language that adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages. It allows developers to create features like image sliders, form validation, and real-time updates. JavaScript interacts with HTML and CSS through the Document Object Model (DOM), enabling content changes without reloading the page. It runs in the user's browser and is essential for building modern web applications. With ES6 and beyond, JavaScript has evolved to support object-oriented and modular programming.</p>
